# Hey, I'm Yohannes 👋

I'm a backend engineer fascinated by **system design**, **distributed systems**, and building production-grade services in **Java** with **Spring Boot**. I care about architecture that scales, code that lasts, and systems that don’t break under pressure.

---

## 🔧 What I Work With

- **Language of choice**: Java
- **Framework of choice**: Spring Boot
- **Architecture**: Microservices, event-driven
- **Infra**: AWS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Docker
- **Build & CI/CD**: Maven, GitHub Actions
- **Security**: OAuth2, JWT

---

## 🛠️ Projects

### 🚀 AutMat  
A microservice-based peer-to-peer payment system that follows real-world architecture and industry best practices. Built to scale, not just to demo.

- Auth, Payments, Notifications, and more
- Uses a common token library for secure JWT generation/validation
- Strong boundaries, service discovery, centralized logging, and tracing

### 🧱 internal-libs  
A shared repo containing foundational Spring Boot libraries:
- **token-provider**: JWT signing/verification with support for key rotation and pluggable claim injection
- **internal-tools**: Common utilities and starter configs used across PayMe and potentially other systems

---

## 🧠 Interests

- **System Design**: Scaling services, bounding contexts, async workflows
- **Distributed Systems**: Eventual consistency, failure handling, messaging patterns
- **Game Dev**: Engine architecture, multiplayer netcode, systems that punish bad latency
- **Military Tech**: Air power (fighters, bombers, missiles, tanks), AI wingmen, integrated command, space warfare tech
